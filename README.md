# steganography
Steganography is a way to communicate messages through pictures. You simply encode the message within the picture and the receiver will decode the message using the picture. 

## Getting Started
User must have python in order to run the scripts.

If the user wants to use the email functionality, the user must ensure that their email settings allow programs to access them.

## Running the Program
Run the steganography.py program and the instructions are given while running the program.  The user is first given the option to encode or decode an image.  If decode is chosen, the user must input an image to be decoded and the message is printed to the screen.  If encode is chosen, the user must input the image filename, text filename that holds the desired message to be encoded, and the output filename for the image with the encoded text. Once the image is encoded, the user then has the option to send the image through email.
